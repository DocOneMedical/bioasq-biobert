## Pre-trained Language Model for Biomedical Question Answering <br> _BioBERT at BioASQ 7b -Phase B_
This repository provides the source code and pre-processed datasets of our participating model for the BioASQ Challenge 7b. We utilized BioBERT, a language representation model for biomedical domain, with minimum modifications for the challenge. 
<br>Please refer to our paper [Pre-trained Language Model for Biomedical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/NEEDMODIFICATION) for more details.
This paper is accepted for an oral presentation in **BioASQ Workshop @ ECML PKDD 2019**.


## The code will be released in October, 2019.
